Our lab has just published a [new paper on eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/45068), investigating the allosteric effects of multiple ligands on the PKM2 enzyme – superb experimental and computational investigations + plus a new package AlloHubMat – a PhD-worth piece of work! Congratulations to Jamie!
