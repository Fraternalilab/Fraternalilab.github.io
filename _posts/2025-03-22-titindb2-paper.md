A major update to the TITINdb platform, [**TITINdb2**](https://titindb.kcl.ac.uk/TITINdb/) expands annotation and structural information for protein variants in the giant sarcomeric protein titin. This resource will support researchers investigating muscle function, cardiomyopathies, and variant effects. Main paper of PhD student Timir Weston!
