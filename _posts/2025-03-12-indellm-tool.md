Work jointly led by Oriol and Vilde in the lab, [IndeLLM](https://github.com/OriolGraCar/IndeLLM) is a novel, plug‑and‑play tool using protein language models for predicting the pathogenicity of in‑frame insertions and deletions (indels). Without requiring fine‑tuning, it outperforms existing methods. Check out our user‑friendly [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/OriolGraCar/IndeLLM/blob/main/IndeLLM.ipynb)!
