First paper from PhD student Lutecia Servius! In this work we compared and evaluated different statistical models in the prediction of Class-Switch Recombination in B cells directly from antibody repertoire data. We found that a dedicated data preprocessing approach collapsing into clonal groups is essential in this problem, and identified similarities and differences between statistical models in their performance and interpretability.
