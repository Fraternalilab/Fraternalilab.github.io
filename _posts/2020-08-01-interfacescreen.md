We celebrate two papers on a new *in silico* method to screen existing crystal lattices available in the Protein Data Bank, for lattices suitable for carrying out fragment soaking experiments to design chemical inhibitors targeting protein-protein interactions! See this paper in [J Med Chem](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00403) for description and application on two attractive therapeutic targets (p38-alpha and interleukin-1-beta).

In a subsequent work now published in [Frontiers in Pharmacology](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.615211) we apply the method to analyse existing lattices containing the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our collaborator Gian-Felice de Nicola at the Randall has managed to generate a novel crystal form which exposes the interface between RBD and ACE2, making it available for fragment screening to develop inhibitors that target this interaction!
