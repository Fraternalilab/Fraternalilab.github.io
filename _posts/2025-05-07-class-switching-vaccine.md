Part of the BBSRC-funded Mapping antibody class switch mechanism and function (MACSMAF) consortium that we lead, together with the labs of Deborah Dunn-Walters (Surrey) and Claudia Mauri (UCL) we generated a multi-omic, longitudinal dataset of B cell in a primary immune response. Our analysis reveals that upon activation, B cells simultaneously produce sterile transcripts from multiple IGH constant regions (up to *IGHG2*) and simlar exhibit a block at IgG2 in their CSR trajectories, challenging the traditional view that classâ€‘switching occurs specifically to one isotype at a time.
