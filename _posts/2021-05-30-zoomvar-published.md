We are delighted that the [ZoomVar](http://fraternalilab.kcl.ac.uk/ZoomVar) database is published in the journal [PLoS Biology](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001207)! Hopefully this tool will be of use to many in annotating protein-level information for missense variants! Congratulation to Anna who began the project and Joseph who pushed this to publication!
