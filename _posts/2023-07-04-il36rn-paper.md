A joint project with Francesca Capon's lab at King's College London, we conducted *in silico* and *in vitro* analysis, this study identifies critical residues in IL36RN essential for the function of the interleukin-36 receptor complex, providing insights into inflammatory skin diseases. Very happy to have contributed our structural bioinformatics expertise to predict and analyse mutational effects.
