The main paper from Marius Kausas' PhD project has been published! This study characterises the conformational dynamics of **HOIP RBR E3 ligase** using integrative modelling, providing new structural insights into ubiquitination machinery.

Read the paper on [Scientific Reports](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18890-6).
