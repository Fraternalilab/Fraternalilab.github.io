Very fruitful collaboration with the lab of Sophia Karagiannis at King's College London! We present here a computational–experimental workflow to rationally design framework (FW) mutations in antibodies. Using trastuzumab as an test case, we identified and validated mutations outside the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) that improved stability while preserving antigen binding. In one case the mutation  decoupled antigen binding from Fc‑mediated effector functions, offering novel avenues for fine‑tuning antibody behaviour.
