Our collaboration with the Dunn-Walters group at University of Surrey has reached a new milestone with our new work on [Frontiers in Immunology](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.602539)! This is our first venture into single-cell RNA sequencing to describe transcriptomic features of different B cell populations. We applied RNA velocity estimation and analysed the transitions between these different cell subpopulations!
