As part of the BBSRC-funded project we have analysed B cell repertoires from infections with SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, and RSV, and reported distinct and unique antiviral antibody responses across pandemic, epidemic, and endemic viruses. We focused specifically on clonal expansions, gene usage, somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination patterns across these different immune challenges. We also contributed a new R package named [BrepPhylo](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/BrepPhylo) for building clonal lineage trees from antibody repertoire data.Very fruitful collaboration with the lab of Deborah Dunn-Walters at University of Surrey.
