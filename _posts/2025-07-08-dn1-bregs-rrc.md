First preprint with us from PhD student Izzy Withnell! In this collaboration with Claudia Mauri's lab at UCL, we devised a novel analytic framework to analyse scRNA-seq data of B cells in cancer, to identify cancer-specific and common B cell states from diverse datasets. We then focused on a renal cell carcinoma (RCC)‑enriched B cell subset(CD27-IgD- 'DN1' B cells), and observed that these cells reside within immature tertiary lymphoid structures. These cells were spatially associated with IL‑10+ and TGFβ+ CD8+ T cells and, when stimulated via TLR agonists, suppressed CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. These DN B cells are thus implicated as pro‑tumorigenic players in RCC.
