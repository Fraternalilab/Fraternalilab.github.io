Our post-doc Rasha’s work on analysing protein-protein interaction networks in the context of the gene C9orf72 affected in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is featured on promotional materials of the charity Motor Neurone  Disease Association! This is an exciting collaboration between the Fraternali lab and Dr Jean-Marc Gallo from the Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, IoPPN at King’s.
