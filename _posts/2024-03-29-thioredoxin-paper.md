As joint work with Claudia Mauri's group at UCL, we contributed our computational expertise to analyse scRNA-seq analysis of regulatory B cell cultures. Our study identified thioredoxin as a metabolic rheostat controlling regulatory B cells. This work sheds light on the metabolic control of immune regulation and has potential therapeutic implications.
