Work led by Oriol! We have revamped our allostery analysis tool into a new version named [AllohubPy](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/AlloHubPy), introduces an information-theoretic approach analysing molecular dynamics simulations, for detecting allosteric signals in proteins. This method provides a powerful framework for understanding communication pathways in biomolecules, with potential applications in drug discovery.
