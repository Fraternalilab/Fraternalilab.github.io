Work from PhD student Dongjun! [VCAb](https://fraternalilab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/VCAb/) is a new web tool for structure-guided exploration of antibodies. It integrates sequence, structural, and functional information, enabling scientists to visualise and analyse antibody features in detail.

Read the paper on [Bioinformatics Advances](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioadv/vbae137).
