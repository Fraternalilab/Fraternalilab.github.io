Our collaboration to study B-cells in melanoma, with the group of Sophia Karagiannis at King's, has just been published in Nature Communications! Here, we collaborated with the Karagiannis to analyse antibody repertoire from B cells infiltrated in melanoma tissues. We described features in these repertoires and drew parallel with autoimmunity.

Read the paper on [Nature Communications](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39042-y). We also have a news story on this work, on the [King's web page](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/study-uncovers-how-b-cells-react-to-skin-cancer).
