In a collaboration between the Fraternali lab and the Conte lab at the Randall Centre at King's College London, we studied the allosteric regulation of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), a key enzyme involved in epoxy fatty acid metabolism relevant in a range of cardiovascular and central nervous systems disorder. This work uncovers how nitro fatty acids allosterically regulate sEH, offering mechanistic insights into enzyme modulation. We are happy to have contributed our computational expertise in the analysis of enzyme allostery!
