**Biography**

Oriol is a passionate and driven researcher with a strong academic foundation and a deep curiosity for the intersection of biology, computation, and health sciences. Graduating with First Class Honours in Biochemistry at the University of Barcelona, he went on to complete an MSc in Bioinformatics Applied to Health Sciences at University Pompeu Fabra, where he explored the integration of multi-omics and molecular simulation data to understand disease mechanisms. He later earned his PhD with Distinction at the University of Boku (Vienna), focusing on algorithmic approaches to study drug binding interactions, enhanced sampling and allostery.

**Research Interests** : His research interests lie at the interface of computational biology, computational chemistry, and artificial intelligence with a big emphasis on developing tools to tackle complex biological questions. Oriol is particularly interested in:

* Molecular Dynamics
* Interpretable AI
* Enhanced sampling

In both academic and collaborative projects, Oriol brings a rigorous analytical mindset, a commitment to open science, and a drive to turn data into actionable health insights. He is currently exploring how data biases affect the new state of the art models and how these tools can be combined to help diagnose dilated cardiomyopathy.
