Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and brought up in the sunny northeast coast of Brazil, Julian has been interested in all things of science from very early. He graduated with first class degree of BSc in Computer Science at the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL) in Brazil. The next milestone was finishing with distinction the MSc in Bioinformatics programme of King's College London, under supervision of Prof. Franca Fraternali. During a pause in his academic life, Julian had extensive work experience in the software industry, from software development for mobile devices to low level software engineering and finally software architecture, with specialisation on cloud, high-performance and distributed computing. Julian recently re-joined Fraternali's group now as a part-time PhD student. He is studying the impact of non-synonymous variants in protein stability and function within the context of multiomics data analysis facilitated by the application of machine/deep learning techniques.
