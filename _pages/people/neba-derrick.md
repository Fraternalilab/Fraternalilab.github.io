Neba obtained a B.Sc. in Biochemistry with a Minor in Medical Lab Technology form the University of Buea in Cameroon. He then continued in the same university where he graduated in 2018 with a M.Sc. in Biochemistry. Then, Neba joined Prof Franca Fraternali’s lab as an MPhil/PhD student completely funded by the Darwin Trust of Edinburgh. Neba’s research is aimed at identifying protein-protein interaction targets of biological and clinical importance for *in silico* fragment based screening, using software tools developed in the Fraternali laboratory and other bioinformatics/computational methods.
