Lutecia is doing a PhD in Statistics as part of the BiPAS (Biological Physics Across Scales) CDT at Kingâ€™s, undertaking interdisciplinary research between Statistics and Bioinformatics. Currently, she is working on developing statistical methods to further understanding of Class Switch Recombination in B cells.  

Before her PhD, she studied Physics (BSc MPhys) at the University of Warwick where her thesis focused on the integrability of a 1D quantum system.

Other than her interest in multi-disciplinary research, Lutecia has also co-founded the King's chapter of the Piscopia intiative (<https://piscopia.co.uk/>) which seeks to create a support network for women and non-binary students and researchers in Mathematics and related disciplines.
