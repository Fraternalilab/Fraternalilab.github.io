I am a biochemical researcher with a focus on exploring the structure-function relationships of proteins through a combination of advanced computational and experimental approaches. My research portfolio encompasses the rational design of proteins, molecular docking, multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, and cutting-edge deep learning-based tools to characterize protein-protein interactions and develop novel biomolecular solutions. 

At Fraternali's group, my work centers on designing self-assembling peptides that form virus-like nanoparticles as a pioneering strategy to combat bacterial infections by integrating de novo design techniques with structural prediction methods and molecular dynamics simulations.
