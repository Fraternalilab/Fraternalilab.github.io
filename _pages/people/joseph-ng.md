Joseph was born and raised in Hong Kong, and graduated with first class honours the degree of Bachelor of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). He did his PhD in the Fraternali lab, supported by the [Croucher Foundation](https://www.croucher.org.hk/) from Hong Kong, on mutators (proteins which generate mutations) and cancers, specifically focusing on the mechanism of the APOBEC3 family of proteins. He is broadly interested in cataloguing signatures of biological sequences, structures and networks, and use these to formularise the “molecular grammar”. His work at the lab centres around annotation of mutational impact, mapping pathway and functional information on biological networks, and analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data. He is currently a post-doc, working on the MACSMAF (Mapping antibody class switch mechanisms and function) project supported by a BBSRC sLoLa grant.

Outside science, Joseph is also interested in ethical and policy questions surrounding medicine. He is particularly fascinated by [directed-to-consumer genomic testing](http://jme.bmj.com/content/42/10/649).
