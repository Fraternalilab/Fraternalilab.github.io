Dongjun obtained the degree of BS in Biomedical Sciences at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech, China) in 2020, awarded with the excellent graduate for exceptional performance in SUSTech. She then finished her PhD in computational biology, in Fraternali’s lab at King’s College London, where she applies both the biophysical methods and artificial intelligence to decipher the assembly of antibody structures. Her work focuses on developing new tools and methods in facilitating the rational design of new therapeutic antibodies.

**Research Interests** : Outside of her project, Dongjun is interested in how artificial intelligence will change the science and society.
