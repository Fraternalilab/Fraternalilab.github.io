**Caroline Babisz** is doing her PhD as part of the London Interdisciplinary Doctoral Training Programme (LIDo), funded by the BBSRC. In her project she is using experimental and computational approaches to unravel the complex mechanisms behind kinase substrate specificity. She is working between UCL with Professor Franca Fraternali and QMUL with Dr Tanya Soliman.

Before starting her PhD, Caroline studied Biology (BSc) at the University of Leeds and Plant and Microbial Biology (MRes) at the University of Sheffield.

Other than her love for kinases, Caroline is passionate about science communication and in her free time she does science writing and gets involved with public engagement projects.
