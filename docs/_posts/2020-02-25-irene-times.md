We are very happy that Irene’s work on simulating self-assembly of an antimicrobial nanocapsule has been featured on [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/man-made-antibacterial-virus-offers-hope-in-superbug-fight-0pv25ld2t).

Read the story on [King’s website](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/kings-scientists-help-develop-artificial-virus-to-combat-superbugs). The paper was published on [ACS Nano](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.9b06814).
