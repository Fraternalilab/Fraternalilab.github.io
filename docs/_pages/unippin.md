**UNIPPIN: An integrated human protein-protein interaction network**

The group has been collecting and integrating protein interaction data from different major protein-protein interaction (PPI) databases and high-quality experimentally determined PPI data. By integrating all these data sources we compiled a Unified PPI network (UNIPPIN)  for our analyses, ranging from extraction of topological features to mapping of genetic variants, protein-protein complex structures and protein-ligand interactions (drugs and allosteric ligands).
