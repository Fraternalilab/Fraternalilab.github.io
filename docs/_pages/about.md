Research at the Fraternali group aims to identify molecular determinants in the functioning or mis-functioning of protein structures and protein-protein interactions.  The wider objective is to understand, at a molecular level, the nature of the interactions occurring in the cell. We use bioinformatics methods to analyse available data on protein structures and protein interactions, and molecular simulations and/or computational biology methods to characterize and determine their stability.
