**Biography**

* Head, Randall Centre of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King’s College London
* Professor of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Randall Centre, King’s College London
* Staff Scientist, National Institute for Medical Research of London
* Research Associate, EMBL Heidelberg
* Post Doctoral Research Fellow, University of Strasbourg
* EMBO Fellowship, ETHZ, Zurich
* PhD in Physical Chemistry, University of Naples

**Research Interests** : Structural Bioinformatics of Proteins and Nucleic acids; Protein Structure Prediction; Molecular Dynamics of folded and misfolded proteins; Systems Biology; Statistical Analysis of Protein Interaction Networks.

The research of the group aims at identifying the molecular determinants in the functioning or misfunctioning of protein structures and protein-protein interactions. The wider objective is to understand, at a molecular level, the nature of the interactions occurring in the cell.

I am particularly interested in the study of the physical nature of the interactions between protein-protein, protein-solvent, protein-lipid and protein-nucleic acid. We develop methods in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology to analyse the available data on such interactions and molecular simulations and to characterize and determine their stability. Once these key molecular signatures have been identified, one can propose ‘rescue’ mutants to restore the protein function, one can design proteins with enhanced binding; one can design inhibitors to disrupt the binding.
