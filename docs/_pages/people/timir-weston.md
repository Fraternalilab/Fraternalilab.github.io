NIHR BRC PhD Student

Email: timir [dot] weston [at] kcl [dot] ac [dot] uk

Timir studied for a BA in Biological Sciences at Somerville College, University of Oxford. From there, he graduated from Imperial College London with an MSc in Applied Biosciences and Biotechnology before attending King’s College London as part of the NIHR BRC Doctoral Training Programme, being awarded an MRes in Biomedical and Translational Science, and joining Prof Franca Fraternali’s lab as a PhD Student. His current work involves the study of the giant sarcomeric protein obscurin and elucidation of its relationship to cardiomyopathies using computational and dynamical methods, and trying to develop predictive tools that can be used to identify and characterise novel variants, with the aim of expanding this work to other giant proteins such as titin.
